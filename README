This is a crc lib to allow to calculate efficiently CRCs of almost
all classes.  Most polynomials have been obtained from the Wikipedia.
Sorry if some of them are misspeled.

It allows you to generate new tables based on new CRC polinomials.

Sorry, documentation is at this moment in my head... I'll try to
write down it soon. :)

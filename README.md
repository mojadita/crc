# INTRODUCTION

This is a crc lib to allow to calculate efficiently CRCs by table
of almost all classes.  Most polynomials have been obtained from
the Wikipedia.  Sorry if some of them are misspeled.

Calculations are always done considering the least signifiant bit
as the largest grade bit in the polinomial division.  At this
moment there's no provision for the other way, but work is going
on it.

It allows you to generate new tables based on new CRC polinomials.

Sorry, documentation is at this moment in my head... I'll try to
write down it soon. :)
